# Fridgerator
## Introduction

The goal of this Project was to develope a mobile Application that can run on Android, iOS and Web. It is written with React Native & Expo(https://expo.dev/) in TypeScript + a Google Firebase Realtime Database called Firestore.
Aim was to make a "Fridgerator", an Application that helps you to maintain kitchen inventory inlcuding your Fridge. 
## Current development state

The basic function like Add, Delete, Update and Sort are working fine. The integration of a QR-Code scanner is not working yet but almost complete integrated.
